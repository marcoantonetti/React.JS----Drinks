# React Proyect


This is a sample website of an ecommerce drink-shop. 

You can see all of the catalogue, separate it by categories and subcategories using the nav bar dropdowns.

Each item can be clicked on and a detailed view of said item will show up.

In there you can add as many items to the shopping cart as the stock lets you

The website isnt as complete as anyone would like, but it meets the requierements for my Coder House React Course Certification
On my upcoming website proyects the code and size of the website will achieve a more professional level
